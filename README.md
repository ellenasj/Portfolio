## About Me
Hi, welcome to my GitHub portfolio. 

My name is Ellena Sarah Josephine. I'm a software tester with 2 years of experience. I'm passionate about creating test cases and finding bugs. I understand that in order to create test cases covering all testing scenarios it's crucial to have deep understanding of the business requirements and consider the end user's point of view. That's why I always strive to adopt the end user's point of view during creating the test case and during the testing process.

I'm an organized, diligent, and passionate learner specifically in learning automation testing. Currently, I'm learning Selenium WebDriver and Jmeter by attending online courses and creating a mini project for my learning purpose.

I am excited to be given a chance to prove my skills to the company's project. Being an automation tester is my career goal due to many development opportunities.
